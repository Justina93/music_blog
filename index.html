          Flower of Scotland,
          When will we see
          Your likes again,
          That fought and died for,
          Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
          And stood against them,
          Proud Edward's Army,
          And sent them homeward,
          Tae think again.

          The Hills are bare now,
          And Autumn leaves
          lie thick and still,
          O'er land that is lost now.

        <p>
          Those days are past now,
          And in the past
          they must remain,
          But we can still rise now,
          And be a nation again,
          That stood against them,
          Proud Edward's Army,
          And sent them homeward,
          Tae think again.

          My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here,
          My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
          Chasing the wild-deer, and following the roe,
          My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.

          Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,
          The birth-place of Valour, the country of Worth;
          Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
          The hills of the Highlands forever I'll love.

          Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods,
          Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.
